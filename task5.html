    <p><u>Amaravathi</u> is a village on the banks of the Krishna River, in the Palnadu district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[4]<b>It is the headquarters of Amaravathi mandal,</b>[5] and forms part of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region with its headquarters at new Amaravati 35 km (22 mi) east, whose name is also borrowed from that of the older Amaravathi.<b><u>The 13th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu</u></b> envisioned Amaravati to be the people-centric pioneer Smart City of India, built around sustainability and livability principles, and to be the happiest city in the world.[22] Among the innovative features on the drawing board are navigation canals[23] around the city, and connecting to an island in the Krishna River. The Government has envisaged an investment needed[24] of US$2â€“4 billion for the development of the city.[25][6]


        Amaravathi was founded by Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu in the 1790s as the new capital of his Zamindari estate. He moved there from his former capital Chintapalli in protest of alleged mistreatment by the British East India Company. Amaravathi is named after the ancient Amaravati Stupa, which was unearthed in the process of the town's construction.[7][8] It is adjacent to the ancient Satavahana capital Dhanyakataka (now called Dharanikota).[9]</p>
